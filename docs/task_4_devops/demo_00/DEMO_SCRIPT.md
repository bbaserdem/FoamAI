# FoamAI Demo Presentation Script
**🎯 1-Minute Demo: "FoamAI CFD Assistant - Infrastructure Complete"**

---

## 🎬 **Opening (15 seconds)**

> **"Today I'm presenting FoamAI - an AI-powered CFD assistant that makes
fluid dynamics accessible through natural language.
Let me show you what we've built so far."**

**[Show this slide/screen]:**
```
🌊 FoamAI: AI-Powered CFD Assistant
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Production Infrastructure: DEPLOYED
✅ FastAPI Backend: RUNNING  
✅ ParaView Server: ACCESSIBLE
🚧 CFD Intelligence: IN DEVELOPMENT
```

---

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Achievement (20 seconds)**

> **"We've successfully deployed a complete production infrastructure on AWS.
This includes a c7i.2xlarge instance running three containerized services:
our FastAPI backend, OpenFOAM solver, and ParaView server for visualization."**

**[Execute live command 1]:**
```bash
# Show infrastructure status
curl -s http://35.167.193.72:8000/ | jq
```
**Expected output:** `{"message": "FoamAI API is running!"}`

> **"The API is live and responding.
Let me check the ParaView server connectivity..."**

**[Execute live command 2]:**
```bash
# Test ParaView server
nc -zv 35.167.193.72 11111 && echo "✓ ParaView Server: ACCESSIBLE"
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation (15 seconds)**

> **"We've built comprehensive testing tools to validate our deployment.
Watch this quick system validation..."**

**[Execute live command 3]:**
```bash
# Run quick validation
./test-foamai-quick.sh 35.167.193.72 | grep -E "(SUCCESS|API:|Server:)"
```

> **"All green! Our infrastructure is production-ready."**

---

## 🚀 **Architecture & Next Steps (10 seconds)**

> **"The architecture follows a hybrid client-server model with Docker containers,
AWS ECR integration, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.
Our next phase implements the AI agents for natural language CFD simulation setup."**

**[Show this slide/screen]:**
```
📋 DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
🚧 Phase 2: OpenFOAM Integration  
🚧 Phase 3: Natural Language Processing
🚧 Phase 4: Desktop Client
```

**[Execute live command 4 - Optional if time]:**
```bash
# Show API documentation
echo "API Documentation: http://35.167.193.72:8000/docs"
```

## 🎪 **Backup Demo Commands** 
*(If you have extra time or questions)*

```bash
# Show comprehensive test results
python test-foamai-service.py --host 35.167.193.72

# Show infrastructure details  
cd infra && terraform output

# Show Docker environment
ssh -i ~/.ssh/foamai-key ubuntu@35.167.193.72 'docker ps'
```

## 💡 **Demo Tips**

1. **Practice the timing** - Run through once to ensure 60 seconds
2. **Pre-test commands** - Verify all commands work before presenting
3. **Have backup plan** - If network issues, show local testing instead
4. **Emphasize achievement** - This is a significant infrastructure accomplishment
5. **Be confident about future** - The foundation enables the AI features
