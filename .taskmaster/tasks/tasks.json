Comprehensive Documentation:\n- Created detailed `EBS_VOLUME_MOUNTING.md` with troubleshooting guide\n- Updated `terraform.tfvars.staging` with new configuration options\n- Added `infra/README.md` with quick start and configuration guide\n\nBenefits Achieved:\n- Eliminates device name mismatch issues\n- Handles EBS volume timing problems  \n- Provides configurable deployment options\n- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms\n- Enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities\n- UUID-based persistence for reliability\n- Maintains deployment continuity even with volume failures\n\nTesting Strategy:\n- Staging deployment validation with `./deploy-fresh-instance.sh`\n- Enhanced status script: `sudo foamai-status`\n- Comprehensive logging: `/var/log/foamai-startup.log`\n- Multiple discovery strategy validation\n\nThe implementation addresses the original /data partition mounting issue while providing a robust, configurable, and maintainable solution for future deployments.\n</info added on 2025-07-11T14:21:26.361Z>",
