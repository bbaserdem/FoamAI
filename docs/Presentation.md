# Presentation

## First Slide

- Contains our logo
- FoamAI

## CFD

- Computational fluid dynamics; or more general continuum mechanics.
- Model liquid or air flow, heat distribution, material strength etc.
- Useful in many settings

## Uses

- Hobbyists can check thermal or aerodynamics of their 3D prints
- Biologists can model drug delivery, circulation
- Aquarium design can be modelled for water circulation, co2 distribution
- Artists can design new artforms
- Can test cooling systems before deployment, for HVAC or PC cooling

## Third slide: State of current software

- Propriety solutions expensive, and not very expandible.
(ANSYS Fluent, SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation, Autodesk CFD)
- Not very viable for hobbyists and academics.

- OpenFOAM is very powerful, and open source.
- Very extendable, and community maintained.

But

## Fourth slide: Cumbersome

- Image of a biologist/chemist in a lab, holding their head in despair with
words/images related to technical details of CFD floating around menacingly.
- The words/images can be "hyperparameters", "meshing", "reynold number",
"compilation", "cpp", "CAD", "stl", "visualization", "solid transfort", "grid correction"

It's very difficult to install and get working.
Very high learning curve, needs both technical understanding and coding skills.

## FoamAI

- Bring the power of AI so that OpenFOAM is easily interfaced with English.
- An AI assistant that bridges the many moving parts

# Speech

## Opener

Hi everyone — I'm excited to introduce you to FoamAI,
a tool we’re building to make powerful simulation tools accessible to everyday people.

FoamAI helps with computational fluid dynamics,
or CFD — which is the science of simulating how fluids like air or water move.
CFD is part of continuum engineerding; modelling things that flow, bend, and deform;
like air, water, engine parts and even heat.

While CFD sounds like something only rocket scientists use,
it actually has surprising everyday value.

- Hobbyists can it to test 3D printed parts.
- Biologists can model drug delivery and blood flow.
- People can design aquarium circulation
- Artists can use it to model fluids for performance art.

But today, most CFD tools are built for enterprise.
They’re prohibitively expensive, and not very extensible.
But there is an open source version.

## Closer

I got into CFD through research — I was trying to model animal behavior
in an airflow environment, and started working with OpenFOAM.
It took me two weeks to set it up, and struggled with it for three months to
tailor it to my project, and even then, I had to stop because of time and funding limits.

There are many projects like this in science, which could benefit a lot from
CFD being much more accessible.
An open question in neuroscience that I know is how airflow through a mouse’s nose
carries smells to different parts — and CFD could answer it.
FoamAI is our way of breaking that wall down — so that researchers, makers,
and curious minds can simulate the world around them — without needing a dual PhD
in physics and computer science, or a million-dollar budget.
